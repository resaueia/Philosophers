# Philosophers
The dining philosophers problem - 42 Project

This project implements the classic **"Dining Philosophers Problem"** using the C programming language. The program is designed to respect synchronization and threading constraints, using mutexes to prevent race conditions.

---

### Execution
After compilation, the program can be executed as follows:
```bash
./philosophers <number of philosophers> <time to die> <time to eat> <time to sleep>
```

- `<number of philosophers>`: Number of philosophers (and forks) at the table.
- `<time to die>`: Time in milliseconds a philosopher can go without eating before dying.
- `<time to eat>`: Time in milliseconds a philosopher spends eating.
- `<time to sleep>`: Time in milliseconds a philosopher spends sleeping.

**Example:**
```bash
./philosophers 5 800 200 200
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:
1. **`main.c`**: Contains the main function and initializes the simulation.
2. **`philosophers.c`**: Implements the philosophers' routines (thinking, eating, sleeping).
3. **`utils.c`**: Provides helper functions like time tracking and message printing.
4. **`philosophers.h`**: Header file with all project definitions and declarations.
5. **`Makefile`**: Automates the compilation process.
6. **`README.md`**: This document explaining the project.

## üîÑ Execution Flow

### `main` Function
1. Reads and validates the input arguments.
2. Initializes the simulation structure (`t_simulation`) with the necessary configurations and resources:
   - Creates mutexes for the forks.
   - Initializes the philosophers and their respective threads.
3. Starts the simulation by calling `start_simulation()`.
4. Cleans up allocated resources at the end by calling `cleanup_simulation()`.

### `start_simulation` Function
- Creates a thread for each philosopher, each running the `philosopher_routine`.
- Monitors the philosophers' state to check if any have died.

### `philosopher_routine` Function
Each philosopher executes a continuous cycle of actions:
1. **Thinking**: The philosopher reflects before attempting to eat.
2. **Eating**: The philosopher tries to pick up two forks (mutexes) and eats for a certain time.
3. **Sleeping**: After eating, the philosopher rests for a certain time.

### Auxiliary Functions
- **`print_message`**: Prints synchronized messages to the console, such as "philosopher picked up a fork" or "philosopher is eating."
- **`get_timestamp`**: Gets the current timestamp in milliseconds for time tracking.

## üß† Key Concepts

### Threads
The program uses **threads** to simulate the parallel behavior of each philosopher. Each thread represents a philosopher, executing its routine independently.

### Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
Forks are represented by **mutexes**. Only one philosopher can "pick up" a fork at a time, ensuring no two philosophers attempt to use the same fork simultaneously, preventing race conditions.

### Synchronization
Message printing and resource allocation are synchronized using mutexes to avoid inconsistencies in output and program state.

## üìö Understanding the Dining Philosophers Problem

In the **Dining Philosophers Problem**, a circular table has:
- **N philosophers** alternating between thinking, eating, and sleeping.
- **N forks**, where each philosopher needs two forks to eat.

Rules:
1. Only one philosopher can use a fork at a time.
2. A philosopher can pick up the fork to their left and the fork to their right to eat.
3. A philosopher who cannot pick up two forks must wait.

Challenges:
- Avoiding **deadlocks**: Situations where all philosophers are waiting indefinitely for forks.
- Ensuring **mutual exclusion**: Only one philosopher can use each fork at a time.

## üîé Example Output

```plaintext
0 1 is thinking
10 2 is thinking
20 1 picked up the left fork
30 1 picked up the right fork
30 1 is eating
50 2 picked up the left fork
60 2 picked up the right fork
60 2 is eating
90 1 is sleeping
100 2 is sleeping
```

## üßπ Cleaning Up

To remove compiled files, run:
```bash
make clean
```

To remove all binaries and object files, run:
```bash
make fclean
```
